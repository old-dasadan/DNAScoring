# DNAScoring
# Abstract
At present, the problems of high error rate and high redundancy still exist in the DNA storage technology. The solution of these problems is restricted by the development of DNA synthesis and sequencing technology. In particular, errors such as substitution, insertion, and deletion occur during DNA synthesis, which greatly increases the error rate of DNA storage. The probability of these errors in DNA synthesis is determined by the severity of the secondary structure that may be formed by the synthesized DNA sequence. Therefore, it is of great significance to find a method to judge the quality of the DNA sequences encoded in DNA storage by the severity of DNA secondary structure. The core aim of this work is to propose such a method for predicting the severity of secondary structure that may be formed by a DNA sequence and to screen out the ones of poor quality from a set of DNA sequences in DNA storage. Here, we implemented a dataset about DNA sequences and secondary structure score based on Mfold, a classic secondary structure prediction algorithm, and we constructed a deep learning model based on LSTM to predict and score the severity of the secondary structures of the DNA sequence. The constructed model can give a corresponding secondary structure severity score according to a given DNA sequence or a set of DNA sequences. The high classification accuracy of the model results indicate that the method proposed by this work can be used as an important basis for evaluating the quality of the DNA sequences encoded in DNA storage.
